        <p>Here we see a visualization of the humidity over a number of cities located at different latitudes.
          <br> This dataset was collected on January 05, 2017. It seems a number of cities had high humidity on 
          <br> this day. We can see that there is a large band of cities with 100% humidity, all across the globe. 
          <br> However, there does not seem to be a discernable pattern, because humidity values range randomly
          <br> from 0% in some cities to 100% in others, across different latitudes.
