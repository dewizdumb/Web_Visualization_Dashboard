        <p>Here we see a visualization of the windspeed on January 5, 2018 over a number of cities located at different latitudes.
          <br> This visualization shows no discernable pattern of wind speeds according to latitude. The day seems largely calm for 
          <br> most cities, with most gusts ranging from 0 to 10 miles per hour. The highest wind speed caught on this particular
          <br> day in these cities was just over 35 MPH.
