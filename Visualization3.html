        <p>Here we see a visualization of the cloudiness over a number of cities located at different latitudes.
          <br> on January 05, 2017. There does not seem to be a discernable pattern, because cities range in 
          <br> cloudiness randomly from 0% in some cities to 100% in others. As such, we cannot conclude a   
          <br> difinitive relationship between cloudiness and latitude.
