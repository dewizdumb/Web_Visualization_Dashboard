      <p>Here we see a visualization of the max temperature over a number of cities located at different latitudes.
        <br> This dataset was collected on January 05, 2017. During this time of year the Northern hemisphere (latitude > 0°) 
        <br> is in the winter season, so the max temperature falls as we go father north (ie- as latitude increases). As we
        <br> approach the equator, which is closest to the sun in the winter, the temperature increases. There don't seem to 
        <br> be any cities located below -60°, perhaps corresponding to the dearth of people living in the antarctic circle.
